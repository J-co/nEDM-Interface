### Introduction

These are examples for dealing with building site components.  The sites
involve both [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery
Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) which are both industry standard packages to
aid in building websites, in particular on mobile devices.

Other javascript libraries are also made available using
[kan.so](http://kan.so), which is a package management tool for deploying
CouchApps on CouchDB.

For more information on CouchDB and how the nEDM-Interface site uses its
features, see {@tutorial couchdb}.
